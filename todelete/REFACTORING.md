## Verification Process
1. Run unit tests for each component
2. Verify results match original implementation
3. Check resource usage and performance
4. Validate configuration handling
5. Test error cases and edge conditions

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep original implementation until refactoring is complete
2. Maintain backup of original files
3. Document all changes in version control
4. Test thoroughly before replacing original code
